		<h1>Design Challenge 1</h1>
		
		<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
		<p>The two websites that I am inspired by are <a href="http://hovercraftstudio.com" target="_blank">Hovercraft Studio</a> and <a href="http://www.nike.com/us/en_us/c/men">Nike</a>.</p>

		<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
		<p>On landing page of <a href="http://hovercraftstudio.com">Hovercraft Studio</a> the logo of the company is placed in the center of the page and is knocked out against a dark image. This gives a very distinct focal point once the page loads and provides a starting point to take in their content. As you scroll down there is an obvious hierarchy in type treatments to give importance to the headline, subhead, body. The use of color is very muted until you get to the work section where there is a bust of color, this allows for the work to have a strong visual impact and lets it become the hero.</p> 

		<p>The <a href="http://www.nike.com/us/en_us/c/men">Nike</a> site has a very direct focal point as well. You are greeted with a stream of rich high impact visuals that are meant to excite and engage the viewer. Within this visuals you see a distinct hierarchy in the typographic treatments with the headlines being bold and prominent and the supporting text small and underneath the headlines. The Nike logo and other supporting brands are tucked away in the top left corner of the header bar. As you scroll down you see the small images that are used to support the main imgages.</p> 

		<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
		<p>First off these two sites play two different roles. The <a href="http://hovercraftstudio.com">Hovercraft Studio</a> site has a direct purpose and that is to act more as a portfolio and to inform prospective clients more about company. The <a href="http://www.nike.com/us/en_us/c/men">Nike</a> site is a blend of brand storytelling and e-commerce. Structurely both sites have a very centered justified layout. Some differences that you will notice are that the <a href="http://www.nike.com/us/en_us/c/men">Nike</a> site has two columns of images as you scroll down as <a href="http://hovercraftstudio.com">Hovercraft Studio</a> has a three column grid to display their work thumbnails. Also <a href="http://www.nike.com/us/en_us/c/men">Nike</a> has a side bar on the left that allows you to go deeper into what merchandise they have available and their header on top is always present no matter how far you scroll down.</p>

		<h2>Thumbnail Sketches</h2>
		<h3>Portfolio Home Page</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><img src="images/GA_WC_Unit_2_Wireframe.jpg"><br>
			<p>This layout uses a large image to give the eye a specific and dominate focal point. The hierarchy is established from the dramatic use of imagery and a distinct level of typographic hierarchy has been established.</p></li>

		</ul>

		<h3>Portfolio Work Page</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><img src="images/GA_WC_Unit_2_Wireframe2.jpg"><br>
			<p>As you scroll down to the work page there is a very clean three column grid system set up to purposely allow each piece of work to be as important as the next. No dominant image is calling out for your attention. There is a hierarchy used in the typography to distinguish a level of importance in messaging.</p></li>
		</ul>
